  <h1>Updating name and gender with Columbia</h1>
  <!-- 1 -->
  <div class="update_name_section_columbia">

    <h2 class="update_name_columbia_section">To Update Name:</h2>
    <p>
      Go to the the Registrar. This is at the Student Service Center at Kent Hall
      You will be asked to fill out <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf">this form.</a> <br>
      The form mentions this must be notarized. If you fill out the form in the Student Service Center, it does not need
      to be notarized.
      If you wish to have the form notarized, the UPS store near The Kraft Center has notaries typically before 12pm.
      They charge around $2. The USPS does NOT have a notary.
    </p>
    <p>Bring copies of:
      A valid photo ID.
      A second form of ID.
    </p>

    <p>
      Proof of use of the previous name.
      This can be:
      Court Order
      Credit Card
      University Card
      Marriage Certificate
      Birth Certificate
      Old Passport
      Bank Statement
      Etc
    </p>

    <div id="note">
      <h3>Note:</h3>
      <p>
        The Mail Center will continue to list your old name unless it is updated through the Columbia Registrar.
        This is problematic if your new Driver's License is mailed under your new name to the Columbia Mail Center.
        To get past this, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask your Driver's License to be mailed to you under your old name</li>
        <li>Have your Driver's License mailed to a friend or family member if under the new name</li>
        <li>Keep the temporary Driver's License and provide this to Columbia as proof of ID</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="photo-id">
      <h3>Photo ID</h3>
      <p>
        The request for a photo ID is difficult to provide if you are unable to get your current Driver's License mailed
        to you through the Columbia Mail Center.
      </p>
      <p>
        A temporary Driver's License can sometimes override this requirement. However, this is inconsistent and really
        depends on the worker you see.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="court-order">
      <h3>Court Order</h3>
      <p>
        A court order alone is NOT sufficient to update your name and gender. You must still provide two forms of
        identification.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="updates">
      <h3>Updates Across System</h3>
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> When you update your name, it will automatically update across ALL systems within the
        span
        of several weeks.</p>
      <p><strong>Gender:</strong> When you update your gender, it will automatically update across several, though not
        all
        systems. Your gender will not be updated with Columbia Health or Columbia Health Insurance. Reasons listed
        further
        below.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">To Update Gender</h2>

    <div class="subsection registrar">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Columbia Registrar:</h3>
      <p class="subsection-text">
        There is no form to update gender at the Columbia Registrar. To update your gender, you must ask in person.
        Please bring a photo ID and your court order/birth certificate demonstrating the correct gender.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection health">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Columbia Health</h3>
      <p class="subsection-text">
        You can self-identify your gender on the Columbia Health portal and update this anytime you wish, with no
        documentation necessary.
        When you update your sex in the Columbia Registrar, it does <strong>NOT</strong> automatically update your
        gender in Columbia Health.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection insurance">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Columbia Insurance</h3>
      <p class="subsection-text">
        When you update your sex with the Columbia Registrar, it does <strong>NOT</strong> change your sex with
        insurance.
        You will be unable to change your sex with insurance until you have proof of having had specific bottom surgery.
        The reason for this is that certain services are coded as covered only for a certain sex.
      </p>
      <p class="subsection-example">
        For instance, Columbia will refuse to cover gynecology exams for males.
        So, a transgender man will be listed as female for insurance purposes.
        Likewise, a transgender woman will only be listed as female once she has had bottom surgery.

    <div class="subsection housing">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Housing:</h3>
      <p class="subsection-text">
        <strong>Housing Groups:</strong> If you participate in room selection, those within your group will
        automatically see both your deadname and your sex — even if you have a preferred name on file.
      </p>
      <p class="subsection-text">
        <strong>Summer Housing:</strong> When staying over the summer, you are required to put up “occupancy signs” on
        your dorm room. These signs will have your deadname and UNI on them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection barnard">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Barnard</h3>
      <p class="subsection-text">
        Barnard requires one’s legal name as presented on government ID to be listed down when registering as a guest
        (even if a Columbia student).
        This can lead to some intense questioning in front of friends, the person signing you in, etc. about why your
        legal name differs from your Columbia ID.
