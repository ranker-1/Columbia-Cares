<h1>Updating name and gender with Columbia</h1>
<h3>To update name:</h3>
<p>
Go to the the Registrar. This is at the Student Service Center at Kent Hall
You will be asked to fill out <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf">this form.</a> <br>
The form mentions this must be notarized. If you fill out the form in the Student Service Center, it does not need to be notarized. 
If you wish to have the form notarized, the UPS store near The Kraft Center has notaries typically before 12pm.
They charge around $2. The USPS does NOT have a notary.
</p>
<p>Bring copies of:
A valid photo ID. 
A second form of ID.
</p>

<p>
Proof of use of the previous name.
This can be:
Court Order
Credit Card
University Card
Marriage Certificate
Birth Certificate
Old Passport
Bank Statement
Etc
</p>
<div id="note">
  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <p>
    The Mail Center will continue to list your old name unless it is updated through the Columbia Registrar. 
    This is problematic if your new Driver's License is mailed under your new name to the Columbia Mail Center. 
    To get past this, you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask your Driver's License to be mailed to you under your old name</li>
    <li>Have your Driver's License mailed to a friend or family member if under the new name</li>
    <li>Keep the temporary Driver's License and provide this to Columbia as proof of ID</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="photo-id">
  <h3>Photo ID</h3>
  <p>
    The request for a photo ID is difficult to provide if you are unable to get your current Driver's License mailed 
    to you through the Columbia Mail Center.  
  </p>
  <p>
    A temporary Driver's License can sometimes override this requirement. However, this is inconsistent and really 
    depends on the worker you see. 
  </p>
</div>

<div id="court-order">
  <h3>Court Order</h3>
  <p>
    A court order alone is NOT sufficient to update your name and gender. You must still provide two forms of identification.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="updates">
  <h3>Updates Across System</h3>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> When you update your name, it will automatically update across ALL systems within the span of several weeks.</p>
  <p><strong>Gender:</strong> When you update your gender, it will automatically update across several, though not all systems. Your gender will not be updated with Columbia Health or Columbia Health Insurance. Reasons listed further below.</p>
